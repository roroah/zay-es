-----------------
* Modified RemoteEntityData.RemoteEntitySet.release() to check
    to see if the connection is still connected before sending
    the release message.
* Fixed a bug where really eager sendUpdate() calls were causing
    thread contention with entity set creation.  This would be
    especially true for large sets and short update cycles.
* Fixed a similar future-bug for resetting the filter, too,
    though that one would be much harder to time just right, ie:
    even more bizarre if seen in the wild.
